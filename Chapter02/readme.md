### 2.1.1. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array
```
描述：
    Given a sorted array, remove the duplicates in place such that each element appear only once
and return the new length.
    Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this in place with constant memory.
    For example, Given input array A = [1,1,2],
    Your function should return length = 2, and A is now [1,2].

### 2.1.3 Search in Rotated Sorted Array
```
描述：
Suppose a sorted array is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.
(i.e., 0 1 2 4 5 6 7 might become 4 5 6 7 0 1 2).
You are given a target value to search. If found in the array return its index, otherwise return -1.
You may assume no duplicate exists in the array.
