### 2.1.1. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array
```
描述：
    Given a sorted array, remove the duplicates in place such that each element appear only once
and return the new length.
    Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this in place with constant memory.
    For example, Given input array A = [1,1,2],
    Your function should return length = 2, and A is now [1,2].

### 2.1.2. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array II
```
描述：
Follow up for ”Remove Duplicates”: What if duplicates are allowed at most twice?
For example, Given sorted array A = [1,1,1,2,2,3],
Your function should return length = 5, and A is now [1,1,2,2,3]

### 2.1.3 Search in Rotated Sorted Array
```
描述：
Suppose a sorted array is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.
(i.e., 0 1 2 4 5 6 7 might become 4 5 6 7 0 1 2).
You are given a target value to search. If found in the array return its index, otherwise return -1.
You may assume no duplicate exists in the array.

### 2.1.4 Search in Rotated Sorted Array II
```
描述：
Follow up for ”Search in Rotated Sorted Array”: What if duplicates are allowed?
Would this affect the run-time complexity? How and why?
Write a function to determine if a given target is in the array.

### 2.1.5 Median of Two Sorted Arrays
```
描述：
There are two sorted arrays A and B of size m and n respectively. Find the median of the two sorted
arrays. The overall run time complexity should be O(log(m + n)).
