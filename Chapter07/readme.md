# 7. 查找
## 7.1 Search for a Range
描述
Given a sorted array of integers, find the starting and ending position of a given target value.
Your algorithm's runtime complexity must be in the order of O(log n).

If the target is not found in the array, return [-1, -1].
For example, Given [5, 7, 7, 8, 8, 10] and target value 8, return [3, 4].

## 7.2 Search Insert Position
描述

Given a sorted array and a target value, return the index if the target is found. If not, return the index where it would be if it were inserted in order.

You may assume no duplicates in the array.

Here are few examples.

[1,3,5,6], 5 → 2
[1,3,5,6], 2 → 1
[1,3,5,6], 7 → 4
[1,3,5,6], 0 → 0
